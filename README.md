## Current release v1.1.8

##  Background:

I set out to try and make the softmodding process as pain free and user friendly as possible. You don't need to have a specific MS dashboard version or mess about in menus trying to backup your EEPROM or even working out what version to install. I do it for you, I backup the EEPROM I give you an easy to use settings menu ( NKPatcher Settings ) that has all the info you need to get the gist of things. I have also made it as safe as I possibly can, by having recovery dashboards and fail safes in place in case you remove your dashboard or you format your E partition eg... you can always recover.
		
##### I even added support for 24 dashboard locations, so every other softmod dashboard install location is covered.

###### Note: Making changes in the unprotected C partition is not advised unless you know what you are doing, you will know you are in this mode if you see a folder named "Do not touch anything in here"

## Custom face button XBE launching.

You can create up to 8 custom boot locations that can be activated with the hold of a button on boot.

Currently it supports A,B,X,Y,Start,Back,White and black, Configs are located in E:/UDATA/21585554/000000000000/nkpatcher settings/dashloader/

Simply open the corresponding .cfg file and add the absolute path of what ever you want to load.


## NKPatcher Settings:

NKPatcher, this is the second stage of the Softmod. This is what patches the kernel after the NDURE exploit is executed and gives you all the lovely unsigned code and fancy features.

NKPatcher Settings allows you to modify certain aspects of NKPatcher in a safe manor.	

At the top of each menus there is an "Information" button, this will give you a description of the menu you are in.


## 1. Dashboard Settings   
### 1.1 Backup, Restore or Move
 - This is used to move or restore a clean copy of UnleashX, as well as backup your dashboards.
### 1.2 Dual Booting
Power on using the eject button allows you to load an alternative dashboard.
 - #### Enable dual booting:
   - This option is used to enabled dual booting, you get asked if you would like a dashboard setup for you when you select this option.
 - #### Disable dual booting:
   - This option is used to disabled the dual booting process. You are also asked if you would like the alt dashboard to be removed.
 - #### Update Dualboot.settings:
   - This option is to be used if you want to use your own custom dual booting path, you can use the "OpenDash Dualboot.settings" tool to do this, it explains things.
 - #### Restore Dualboot.settings:
   - This option will restore the stock dualboot.settings file.

	
## 2. EEPROM
### Enable virtual eeprom:
 - This option will enable the virtual eeprom. This will install a copy of your Xbox eeprom.bin to the HDD and use it instead of the onboard one.
### Disable virtual eeprom:
 - This option will disable the virtual eeprom. Allowing you to edit the onboard one. ( not recommended to go modifying the eeprom if you don't know what you're doing )
### Backup EEPROM &amp; Xbox information:
 - This option will load my "Xbox Softmod Tool Kit" and backup the eeprom. You will be taken back to the NKPatcher Settings when complete.
### 2.1 Advanced Features
 - #### Remove Parental Controls:
   - This option will remove the parental controls set by the MSDash without requiring the MSDash.
### 2.1.1 Hard Drive
 - #### Change EEPROM HDD Key:
   - This option will allow you to change your eeprom hdd Key to a known key and relock your Hard drive to this new key. This allows the creation of new hard drive's or fixing your current hard drive a doddle as you will be able to lock these drives with a 32 1s key.
### 2.1.2 Persistent Softmod
 - #### Enable:
   - This option will allow you to re-enable the persistent softmod mode. What this mode does is puts the Xbox into a controlled error 16 state. Don't be alarmed!. This is 100% safe, as long as you don't remove anything from the real C partition. In this mode every game is loaded under the softmod, what this means is IGR on all retail (original) games and never needing worry about losing your softmod again, though with my softmod that's a moot point.
 - #### Disable:
   - This option will allow you to disable the persistent softmod mode. In this mode your xbox will work like any other softmod out there, retail (original) games will bypass the softmod.
### 2.1.3 System Language

   - This option will allow you to change the system language at the eeprom level. This will change ingame languages for PAL releases.
### 2.1.4 Video Region

   - This option will allow you to change your Xbox video region to NTSC, so you can get those lovely HD resolutions. ( using a component cable )
 - #### Set Video to PAL:
   - This option will allow you to change your Xbox video region to PAL, so you can play some of the PAL exclusive games that don't work when set to NTSC.
### 2.1.5 Remove parental controles:
 - This option will remove all parental controls from the xbox, no more Xbox dash yah!


## 3. Fan speed

## 4. Hard Drive
### 4.1 Partition Types
 - #### Default:
   - This is the standard/default option, this allows Partition 6 ( F ) to use all available extra space.
 - #### Partition F & G:
   - This option allows a F and G partition. Where F takes upto 137GB and G takes the remaining space of the drive.
 - #### XBPartitioner:
   - This option is a placebo option, all above options will allow the partition table, I just added this for simplistic reasons.
### 4.2 Populate partitions
 - #### E Partition:
   - Creates "Applications, Emulators, Games and Homebrew" folders.
 - #### F Partition:
   - Creates "Applications, Emulators, Games and Homebrew" folders.

## Source code:

 This softmod is fully open source, you can find the full source code on my GitHub with everything I have used/created in a nice organised manner.
 If you are a windows user, I have created batch files to do most of the heavy lifting, so it makes my life and yours simple when building stuff.

 * **Note:** The Xbox XDK and Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003 is required to build some of the tools.

### [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/JCRocky5):
 There you can find videos on "How to setup your USB Pen and install a Softmod", "How to clone your Hard drive using Chimp 261812 from start to finish." and many other crappy videos I make for the Xbox.
